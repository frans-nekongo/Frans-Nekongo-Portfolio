Hello, I'm Frans Nekongo. I'm a computer science student in my 3rd year. I have a passion for coding and problem-solving, and I love to explore the fascinating world of science and technology.
Through my projects and experiences, I aim to combine my knowledge with curiosity to create ANYTHING..and maybe if im lucky impact society {darth vadaer laugh}.
